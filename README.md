# Calculator-Project : Calculating Basal Metabolic Rate

Project name:
  Calculator-Project
  
Description:
  I created this code to calculate the user's Basal Metabolic Rate, or BMR. This rate is the amount of energy, or calories, your body needs while resting. This accounts for more than half your calories burned in 24 hours. This calculation DOES NOT take account for your physical activity throughout the day, but just the initial energy/calories needed for a body at rest.

Programming Language used: 
  Python 3.8.1
